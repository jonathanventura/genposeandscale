### Introduction
This repository contains MATLAB code for solving the generalized pose-and-scale problem.
The problem and our solution are described in our CVPR 2014 paper.

### Usage
GENPOSEANDSCALE Solves for the pose and scale of a generalized camera.
  [Psolns,ssolns] = genposeandscale(p,d,q)

  p is a 3xN matrix of ray origins
  d is a 3xN matrix of ray directions
  q is a 3xN matrix of anchor points
